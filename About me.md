- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hassan Muhammed.
- 👀 I’m interested in Programming, Cybersecurity, and figuring out why printers stop working at the worst times.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing a BS in Cybersecurity and learning how to outsmart hackers while not locking myself out of my own accounts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve protecting systems, creating tools to fight social engineering, or just making the internet a little less chaotic.
- 📫 How to reach me probably through email, but send snacks if you want a faster reply
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (or Cyber/Secure when I’m in “full hacker mode”).
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can break down complex cybersecurity concepts while watching a football match—and sometimes the match is harder to understand.
